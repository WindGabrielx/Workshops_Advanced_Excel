# Workshops Advanced Excel and Basic Data Management

   Hi, and welcome to my repository! This collection contains various workshops and practice projects I’ve completed to enhance my skills in advanced Excel and data management. Each project provides an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, deepening my understanding of how Excel functions can address real-world problems.

  This repository is dedicated to enhancing data management and analysis skills, focusing on topics such as Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP (Exact and Approximate Match), and other essential Excel functions. These tools are designed to boost efficiency and accuracy in data handling, helping to apply and improve real-world work-life skills. A practical case study includes statistics on the number of new cars registered in Thailand in 2023, based on data from the Department of Land Transport (อ้างอิงข้อมูลจากกรมการขนส่งทางบกประจำปี 2023). Additionally, it includes content on Basic Data Management with Excel, focusing on foundational techniques for organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data.
